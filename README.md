# Movie-Information
A python script to fetch basic movie/ sitcom information from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/)

This is a part of my efforts to learn web crawling. This project consists of scraping information about movies or T.V. Series from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/).
This script is perfect for movie buff programmers who want their terminal to do something different for a change.
Another web crawling application I made is [SPOJ Crawler](https://github.com/singhsd/SPOJ-Crawler), which downloads all submissions made by a user on [SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com).
